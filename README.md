# OS-Project2

# A C Program to find all the primes in a given range by using fork and named pipes. 

## To run this program, run the following commands in the terminal: 

1. make
2. ./primes -l **LowerBound** -u **UpperBound** -[e|r] -n **NumOfNodes**

Note: **LowerBound** and **UpperBound** refers to the range in which you wish to find primes, and **NumOfNodes** refers to the number of nodes each level of the tree has. Flags **-e** or **-r** can be used to specify if the program splits the intervals equally or randomly.
